- Unit management: Define, convert, and verify units across calculations to prevent mistakes.
- Programming interfaces: Use scripting and APIs to automate tasks, build small tools, and integrate with other systems.
- Documentation tooling: Generate and publish docs that describe how your math experiments and unit workflows behave.

Core concepts
- It is a toolkit, not a single application. You combine modules to match your workflow.
- It favors clear, auditable math. Every operation can be traced, repeated, and shared.
- It emphasizes compatibility. You can use familiar formats and patterns to minimize the learning curve.

- Try a few expressions with unit awareness and see the live results.
- Create a small script to automate a calculation sequence.
- Generate documentation for your workflow and share it with teammates.

Getting started with the live math engine
- Basic usage
  - Expression evaluation is straightforward. For example: 2 * (3 + 4) evaluates to 14.
  - Functions are available for common math tasks, like sin, cos, log, and more advanced operations.
- Error handling
  - When an expression has issues, you’ll see a clear message that points to the problem and a suggested fix.
  - Common issues include mismatched parentheses, unknown symbols, and invalid units.

Unit management in depth
- Defining units
  - Create base units (meter, second, kilogram) and define derived units (newton, joule) from them.
- Unit conversions
  - Convert between unit systems (metric, imperial, etc.) with minimal effort.
- Dimensional checks
  - The system prevents mixing incompatible units in a calculation unless you explicitly convert them.
- Practical examples
  - Convert 5 kilometers to miles, or compute velocity in meters per second from distance and time.

Programming interfaces and automation
- API overview
  - The API exposes core functionality for editing math, applying units, and running scripts.
  - You can integrate the toolkit with other software using standard data formats.
- Example script (conceptual)
  - Load a set of measurements.
  - Validate units and apply necessary conversions.
  - Generate a compact report of results with units clearly shown.

Documentation workflow
- Auto-generated docs
  - Documentation pages are built from your math experiments and unit definitions.
  - Each page shows inputs, outputs, and the units involved.
- Manual and tutorials
  - Tutorials guide you through common tasks step by step.
  - A reference section explains the internal APIs and data formats.
- Publishing
  - Docs can be published to a static site, a knowledge base, or an internal wiki.

Examples and tutorials
- Hello world in the live math engine
  - Expression: 1 + 1
  - Result: 2
- Unit aware calculation
  - Define: speed = 30 km/h
  - Convert to m/s and verify: 8.333... m/s
- Script-based workflow
  - Load data: {distance: 12.5, time: 2.5}
  - Compute: speed = distance / time
  - Output: speed with units, formatted for a report

  - Add new math functions, new unit definitions, or new data sources as plugins.
  - Plugins can register new commands and hooks into the workflow.
- Community contributions
  - You can contribute examples, tests, and documentation refinements.
- Best practices
  - Add unit tests to ensure formulas remain correct.
  - Document assumptions and unit choices to keep your work reproducible.

- Interactive exploration
  - Try quick experiments to understand how the engine handles edge cases, such as very large numbers or near-zero values.
  - Observe how unit conversions behave when you change the base unit system.

Working with units and measurements
- Unit registry
  - The registry stores base units and derived units.
  - You can add custom units that reflect your domain needs.
- Conversions
  - The system handles conversions automatically when you call conversion helpers.
  - Be explicit about the target unit if automatic inference would be ambiguous.
- Validation
  - Before running a calculation, you can validate units to catch mistakes early.
  - The validation step can be integrated into automated tests.

Scripting and automation
